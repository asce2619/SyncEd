## General Information
What is Ignition Hacks?

## Project Inspiration 
Elementary education is crucial for a child’s learning and development. We’ve recently seen parents concerned that they’re not involved or don't know their child’s learning process. We decided that to bridge the gap between parents and teachers, we would need to build a platform where teachers can update parents on their child’s progress at school and parents can easily contact their child’s teachers. 

## What does it do?
SyncEd is an application that will allow easy communication between parents and teachers. Teachers and parents will log on with the app taking them to their designated window depending on their role. A teacher will have more control over what is displayed in the child’s progress. There will be an attendance section to mark which students are present, which will be updated live on the parent’s end of the app. The teacher will also be able to display the day plans and change them anytime they want. This will instantly change it on the parent's screens to see what their child’s school day would be like. Additionally, SyncEd allows teachers to post end-of-the-day announcements to tell parents how their child did in class. On the parent’s window, they can view if their child is present, and what their child will be doing for the day, and they can reply to the teacher’s end-of-day message, which will then be displayed on the teacher’s window. 

## Setup
Using JavaFX and Scene Builder, we worked on the front-end development of SyncEd. Scene Builder allowed us to efficiently create the front page, login page, and both the parent’s and teacher’s interfaces in a short amount of time. We used Java for the back-end development, and this included what scene would pop up after a user logs in, how the messages were sent between teachers and parents, and how the day plans were displayed.

## What's next?
For future improvements of SyncEd...
* Add more security within the app ensuring personal information is kept safe.
* Add functionality to the app so that parents and teachers can customize their app.
